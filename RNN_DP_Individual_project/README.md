# RNN_DP_Individual_project

An sample of dataset is available in <tt>data/endoscopy</tt>

Run <tt>main.py</tt> to train the model using your own dataset placed in the <tt>data</tt> folder. (Simply follow the same folder architecture as the provided example).

To see the optional arguments, type <tt>python3 main.py --help</tt>.

## Credits

The model implementation is entirely taken from Wang et al.'s [[1]](#1) [implementation](https://github.com/wrlife/RNN_depth_pose) of their work.
